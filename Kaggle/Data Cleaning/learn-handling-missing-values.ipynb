    "Data cleaning is a key part of data science, but it can be deeply frustrating. Why are some of your text fields garbled? What should you do about those missing values? Why aren’t your dates formatted correctly? How can you quickly clean up inconsistent data entry? In this course, you'll learn why you've run into these problems and, more importantly, how to fix them!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you’ll learn how to tackle some of the most common data cleaning problems so you can get to actually analyzing your data faster.  You’ll work through five hands-on exercises with real, messy data and answer some of your most commonly-asked data cleaning questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at how to deal with missing values.\n",

    "# Take a first look at the data\n",

    "The first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries and dataset we'll be using. \n",

    "For demonstration, we'll use a dataset of events that occured in American Football games.  In the [**following exercise**](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/10824396), you'll apply your new skills to a dataset of building permits issued in San Francisco."
