There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called \"mojibake\" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here's an example of mojibake:\n\næ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n\nYou might also end up with a \"unknown\" characters. There are what gets printed when there's no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding you're using to read your byte string in and they look like this:\n\n����������\n\nCharacter encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n\n> UTF-8 is **the** standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.\n\nIt was pretty hard to deal with encodings in Python 2, but thankfully in Python 3 it's a lot simpler.
